      description: |
        oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) is an open-source
        cross-platform performance library of basic building blocks for deep
        learning applications.

        oneDNN is intended for deep learning applications and framework
        developers interested in improving application performance.
        Deep learning practitioners should use one of the applications
        enabled with oneDNN.

        {% if dnnl_cpu_runtime == "omp" %}
        In this package oneDNN is built with the OpenMP CPU runtime.
        {% elif dnnl_cpu_runtime == "tbb" %}
        In this package oneDNN is built with the TBB CPU runtime.
        {% elif dnnl_cpu_runtime == "threadpool" %}
        In this package oneDNN is built with the Threadpool CPU runtime.
        oneDNN requires the user to implement a Threadpool interface to enable
        the library to perform computations using multiple threads.
        {% elif dnnl_cpu_runtime == "dpcpp" %}
        In this package oneDNN is built with the DPC++ CPU and GPU runtimes.
